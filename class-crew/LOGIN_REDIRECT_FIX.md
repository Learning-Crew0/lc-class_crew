# 🔧 Login Redirect Fix - Complete

## 🐛 Problem

Users were not being redirected to the home page after successful login.

## 🔍 Root Cause

The login component was only handling one response structure, but the backend has **two different login endpoints** with different response formats:

### 1. Admin Login (`/api/admin/login`)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "token": "jwt_token",
  "user": { ... }
}
```

### 2. Regular User Login (`/api/users/login`)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "token": "jwt_token",
    "user": { ... }
  }
}
```

The login component was only checking for the first structure, so regular users couldn't login properly.

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Updated Response Handling
Added support for both response structures:

```typescript
// Handle different response structures from backend
let token: string;
let userFromResponse: Record<string, unknown>;

if (response.success && response.token && response.user) {
    // Admin login structure
    token = response.token;
    userFromResponse = response.user as Record<string, unknown>;
} else if (response.success && response.data && (response.data as any).token && (response.data as any).user) {
    // Regular user login structure
    token = (response.data as any).token;
    userFromResponse = (response.data as any).user as Record<string, unknown>;
} else {
    console.error("Login response missing required fields:", response);
    setError("로그인 응답이 올바르지 않습니다.");
    return;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Redirect Logic
Fixed the redirect timing and added debugging:

```typescript
// Show success message first
alert("로그인이 완료되었습니다.");

// Then redirect to admin page if user is admin, otherwise to home
setTimeout(() => {
    if (userData.memberType === "admin") {
        console.log("Redirecting to admin page");
        router.push("/admin");
    } else {
        console.log("Redirecting to home page");
        router.push("/");
    }
}, 100);
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging
Added console logs to help debug login issues:

```typescript
console.log("Login response:", response);
console.log("User data:", userData);
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### For Regular Users:
1. User enters credentials
2. Frontend calls `/api/users/login`
3. Backend returns `{ success: true, data: { token, user } }`
4. Frontend extracts token and user from `response.data`
5. User is redirected to home page (`/`)

### For Admin Users:
1. Admin enters credentials on `/admin-login`
2. Frontend calls `/api/admin/login`
3. Backend returns `{ success: true, token, user }`
4. Frontend extracts token and user directly from response
5. Admin is redirected to admin dashboard (`/admin`)

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Regular User Login:
1. Go to `/login`
2. Enter regular user credentials
3. Should see "로그인이 완료되었습니다." alert
4. Should redirect to home page (`/`)
5. Check console for "Redirecting to home page" message

### Test Admin User Login:
1. Go to `/admin-login`
2. Enter admin credentials
3. Should see "로그인이 완료되었습니다." alert
4. Should redirect to admin page (`/admin`)
5. Check console for "Redirecting to admin page" message
