## API Functions Used

### Products API
- `getAllProducts(params)` - Fetch products with filters
- `getProductById(id)` - Fetch single product details
- `getAllProductCategories()` - Fetch product categories

### Parameters Supported
- `isActive: true` - Only active products
- `limit: number` - Pagination limit
- `search: string` - Search in product names/descriptions
- `category: string` - Filter by category ID

## Data Transformation

### Product Data Structure
```typescript
interface Product {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  category: {
    _id: string;
    title: string;
  } | string;
  baseCost: number;
  discountRate?: number;
  finalPrice?: number;
  availableQuantity: number;
  images: string[];
  specifications?: Record<string, unknown>;
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### Price Calculation Logic
- **Regular Price**: Uses `finalPrice` or falls back to `baseCost`
- **Discounted Price**: Shows original `baseCost` crossed out with `finalPrice` and discount percentage
- **Formatting**: Korean won format with thousand separators

### Image Handling
- **Primary**: Uses API-provided images from `product.images[]`
- **Fallback**: Uses default store images when API images fail
- **Error Handling**: Automatic fallback on image load errors

## Error Handling & Fallbacks

### Loading States
- Loading indicators during API calls
- Skeleton content while fetching data
- User-friendly loading messages

### Error Handling
- API failure fallbacks to default products
- Image load error handling with default images
- Network error retry mechanisms (built into API utility)
- User-friendly error messages

### Fallback Data
- Default product set maintains UI functionality
- Fallback images ensure visual consistency
- Default categories for product classification

## Features Maintained

### Original UI Elements
- ✅ Product grid layout (4 columns)
- ✅ Product card design and styling
- ✅ Banner section with overlay text
- ✅ Category badges
- ✅ Price display formatting
- ✅ Product detail page layout
- ✅ Image gallery with thumbnails
- ✅ Search results layout
- ✅ Button styles and interactions

### Enhanced Functionality
- ✅ Real product data from backend
- ✅ Dynamic pricing with discounts
- ✅ Stock management and validation
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Category filtering
- ✅ Product specifications display
- ✅ Error handling and recovery

## Testing Recommendations

### API Testing
1. Test with real products from admin panel
2. Verify search functionality with various keywords
3. Test product detail pages with different product IDs
4. Validate price calculations and discount displays

### Error Scenarios
1. Test with network disconnection
2. Test with invalid product IDs
3. Test with empty search results
4. Verify fallback product display

### UI Consistency
1. Verify original design is maintained
2. Test responsive behavior
3. Validate image loading and fallbacks
4. Check loading states and transitions

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Add product filtering by category, price range
- Implement pagination for large product sets
- Add product comparison functionality
- Integrate with cart/wishlist APIs
- Add product reviews and ratings
- Implement advanced search filters

### Performance Optimizations
- Image lazy loading
- Product data caching
- Search debouncing
- Infinite scroll for product lists

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_API` is properly configured for production deployment.

### API Dependencies
- Products API must be available and responding
- Product Categories API should be accessible
- Image URLs from API should be valid and accessible

### Monitoring
- Monitor API response times
- Track error rates and fallback usage
- Monitor user interactions with products
